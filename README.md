# ConnectFour
This is going to be my personal Connect 4 game.

Welcome to my version of Connect 4! Here are the rules:
1. There will be 2 players. These players will be given the option to have their own name, however, by default will be called Player1 and Player2 respectively.
2. One player will possess the X's, and one will possess the O's. The first player to get 4 of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) will be the one to win.
3. Both players will be prompted if they wish to play again. If so, a tally will be kept, and there will be another game.

May the best man win!
